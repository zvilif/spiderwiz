# Spiderwiz
<strong><em>Spiderwiz</em></strong> is an open-source programming model and runtime that dramatically accelerates the development, maintenance and performance of distributed data processing systems.

The programming model is based on the concept of a single data plane shared between multiple compute units. Its power comes from the fact that programmers need not write <strong>a single line of code</strong> in order for that share to happen. Instead of spending the lion share of their life dealing with data serialization, interfaces, service discovery, pub-sub, network protocols and all those thorns of the distributed data processing world, they can concentrate on what they are hired for â€“ achieving their goals.
