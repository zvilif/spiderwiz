/**
 * <em>Data Object Resetting</em> is the operation that takes place when a <em>consumer</em> of a specific <em>data object type</em>
 * detects loss of data. This may happen when the application starts or when data is lost due to a communication problem. In this
 * case, the consumer broadcasts a <em>reset request</em>, asking the producers of that object type to reset all missing objects to
 * their most up-to-date state.
 * <p>
 * When receiving a reset request, the <em>Spiderwiz framework</em> creates a {@code Resetter} object and calls
 * {@link Main#onObjectReset(org.spiderwiz.core.Resetter) Main.onObjectReset()} to give a chance to the application to fulfill the
 * request programmatically. The method returns {@code true} when done this way.
 * <p>
 * If {@code onObjectReset()} returns {@code false} then the framework does automatic reset by fulfilling the request from the
 * governed <em>data object tree</em>. 
 * <p>
 * That parameter to {@code onObjectReset()} is an object of type {@code Resetter} that is documented here.
 * It contains information about the requested object type. It also serves as a
 * carrier to deliver objects back to the requester. As such, it facilitates efficient
 * delivery by directing the reset items to the channel over which they were requested, as well as providing a mechanism for
 * buffering the data and moderate its delivery to avoid network congestion in case of bulk delivery of large amount of items.
 * The class has few methods that can be used to control the delivery process.
 * <p>
 * Note that even if {@code onObjectReset()} returns {@code false}, the framework uses the same {@code Resetter} object that
 * was provided to it for automatic object reset, therefore giving the method a chance to fine tune the {@code Resetter} object
 * used for automatic reset.
