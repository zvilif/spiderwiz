# Spiderwiz
<b><i>Spiderwiz</i></b> is an open-source programming model and runtime that dramatically accelerates the development, deployment, management, maintenance and performance of distributed data processing systems.

The framework is based on the principle of a single data plane shared between multiple compute units. Its power comes from the concept that programmers need not write <b>a single line of code</b> in order for that share to happen. Instead of their modules striving to reach the data, it is <b>the data that reaches them</b>.

That means that instead of programmers that spend the lion share of their life dealing with APIs, service discovery, pub-sub, databases, network protocols and all those goodies of the distributed data processing world, they can concentrate on what they are hired for â€“ achieving their goals.
