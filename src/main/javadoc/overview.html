        <h1>API Overview</h1>
        <p>
            <em><b>Spiderwiz</b></em> programming model is based on a paradigm of distributed computing units sharing a single data plane.
            The sharing mechanism - how a  unit locates the data it needs, how data is routed and transferred, how data modifications
            committed by a  unit are reflected in the shared data and how a  unit gets notified about data modifications
            committed by another  unit - all of this is encapsulated by the framework <em>runtime</em> and is totally transparent to
            the programmer.
        </p>
        <p>
            The data plane of a Spiderwiz framework consists of <b>Data Objects</b>. Data objects are arranged in a
            <em>hierarchy</em> under a single <em>Root Object</em>, therefore forming a <em>Data Object Tree</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each data object has a <b>Type</b>. The type determines the data object <em>structure</em> and <em>topology</em> -
            the types of its <em>properties</em> and its location in the <em>object tree structure</em>. A data object may have an
            <b>ID</b> that makes it unique among all <em>children</em> of a single <em>parent</em> in the data object tree.
        </p>
        <p>
            Compute units may manipulate the data object tree - insert and remove objects. They can also modify data objects properties.
            Each of these actions generates a <b>Data Object Event</b>. As mentioned above, data objects events generated by one
            compute unit may be handled by one or more other  units.
        </p>
        <p>
            In Spiderwiz vocabulary, those compute units are called <b>Data Nodes</b>. Data nodes that generate data object
            events for a specific data object type are called <b>Producers</b> of that type. Data nodes that handle events
            of a specific data object type are called <b>Consumers</b> of that type.
        </p>
        <p>
            Spiderwiz runtime role is to match <em>producers</em> with <em>consumers</em> and to carry data
            <em>modifications</em> and <em>events</em> from the former to the latter swiftly, efficiently and with absolute independence
            on underlying network technologies, protocols and configuration. Here comes <b>Spiderwiz API</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            You will find everything that you need in order to construct a <em>data node</em>, define <em>data objects</em> and start
            to <em>produce</em> and <em>consume</em> them in
            <a href="org/spiderwiz/core/package-summary.html">Spiderwiz Core Package</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The framework requires the use of few Java annotation classes. Their detailed description can be found in
            <a href="org/spiderwiz/annotation/package-summary.html">Spiderwiz Annotation Package</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some utility classes that are used by the framework and you will probably find them useful for general purposes
            are in the <a href="org/spiderwiz/zutils/package-summary.html">Utility Package</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            As mentioned above, as a programmer you need not worry  about the infrastructure under your application, however in
            order to run and perform its goal your application needs to be <b>configured</b>. To do that see
            <span class="colFirst"><a href="org/spiderwiz/core/doc-files/config.html">Spiderwiz Configuration</a></span>.</p>
        <p>Spiderwiz includes an extensive logging system in which logs are generated automatically by the framework, with handy methods for custom logging. See <span class="colFirst"><a href="org/spiderwiz/core/doc-files/logging.html">Spiderwiz Logging System</a></span>.</p>
        <p>Last but most important, Spiderwiz is about data sharing. With its data compression mechanism, it is very efficient and robust about it. To learn how the framework compresses data and how you can control it see <span class="colFirst"><a href="org/spiderwiz/core/doc-files/compression.html">Spiderwiz Data Compression</a></span>.</p>
